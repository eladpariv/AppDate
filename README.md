# AppDate
Description of a social application I have built in react native using expo that based on firebase as it's main source for database and saving data services.
This application enable users to publish temporary post for update to their friend on their current status or event on the time line for future status.
The user can actually update his status for the whole rest of the day while publishing in real time temporary posts for his friends to follow and comment about his actions.
